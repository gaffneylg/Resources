## Resources 

This collection is a subset of what I've found useful during the years, non-exhaustive as naturally it's only a fraction of resources actually used. Only starting to get to compile them into one repo now from what I've got bookmarked/saved elsewhere. 

They take the form of papers, books, eBooks and tutorials/courses I've found useful. Some cheatsheets and scripts thrown in too. Will be padded out more but this
